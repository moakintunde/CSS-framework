# CSS-framework
This framework is my recent tweeks from going around css and discovering web development is not just about creating table structures and designing it. 
2 weeks ago I would have thought HTML and web development is all about Table structures as that has been my belief all along but from this framework and course of learning it goes beyond just creating <tr> table tags, the experience so far is amazing and as i progress I want to make beneficial progress.
In the course of this i made a design for a Quiz platform which I'd share here after gaining a basic of JavaScript.
